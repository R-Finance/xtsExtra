\method{plot}{xts}(x, y = NULL, 
            screens = 'auto', layout.screens = 'auto', ...,
            yax.loc = c("none","out","in","flip", "left", "right", "top"),
            auto.grid=TRUE, major.ticks='auto', minor.ticks=TRUE, 
            major.format=TRUE, bar.col.up = 'white',
            bar.col.dn ='red', candle.col='black',
            xy.labels = FALSE, xy.lines = NULL, 
            ylim = 'auto', panel = default.panel, 
            auto.legend = FALSE, legend.names = colnames(x),

}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{an \code{xts} object}
  \item{y}{an \code{xts} object or \code{NULL}}
  \item{screens}{factor (or coerced to factor) whose levels specify which graph each series is to be plotted in. If not specified, then defaults to a single series per screen for \code{type} not \code{"candles"} or \code{"bars"} See examples.}
  \item{layout.screens}{ Matrix (in a form that could be passed to layout) which arranges screens.}
  \item{yax.loc}{Where to put y-axis labels if they are to be drawn? \code{'none'}, \code{'left'},\code{'right'} are rather self-evident. \code{'in'} and \code{'out'} currently only work for two column layouts. \code{'flip'} attemps to arrange the axes to alternate between the left and right hand sides of the plot to avoid label collision. \code{'top'} is something of a misnomer: it places the y-axis labels above each panel while leaving all plots with their own x- and y-axes. 
  }
  \item{auto.grid}{should grid lines be drawn}
  \item{major.ticks}{should major tickmarks be drawn and labeled}
  \item{minor.ticks}{should minor tickmarks be drawn}
  \item{major.format}{passed along to axTicksByTime.}
  \item{bar.col.dn}{the color of the \dQuote{down} bars when \code{type} is \sQuote{bars} or \sQuote{candles}}
  \item{bar.col.up}{the color of the \dQuote{up} bars when \code{type} is \sQuote{bars} or \sQuote{candles}}
  \item{candle.col}{the color of the candles when \code{type} is \sQuote{candles}. Also the outside of the bars.}
  \item{xy.labels}{label points in scatterplot?}
  \item{xy.lines}{connect points in scatterplot?}
  \item{ylim}{How to handle \code{ylim} for plots. If \code{'fixed'} all panels share \code{ylim = range(x)}; if \code{'auto'} panels sharing a y axis have the same limits. If a numeric matrix, rows are recycled panel-wise as \code{ylim}.}
  \item{panel}{A panel function for plotting; by default, something analogous to \code{lines.xts}. Currently, is passed \code{col}, \code{pch}, \code{type}, \code{lwd}, \code{cex} as calculated internally, so be prepared to handle these arguments, perhaps by receiving them via \code{...} and ignoring. 
  
  If \code{panel != default.panel}, that is, if the user supplies a panel function, the first two arguments passed will be \code{as.POSIXct(index(z))} and \code{z} itself, where \code{z} is the series being plotted in that panel; as a result, note that any plotting inside \code{panel} requires \code{POSIXct}, regardless of the index class of \code{x}. User supplied panel functions will often wish to make use of \code{default.panel}.
  
  Note further that \code{panel} is called for each panel, so the second argument (\code{z}) passed may well be a multi-column \code{xts} object; see \code{xts::default.panel} for how this is handled by default. If a list of panel functions is passed, they are recycled panelwise.}
  \item{auto.legend}{Should a legend be added automatically?}
  \item{legend.names}{Names of series to be passed to the legend writing code. Should be one name per series plotted.}
  \item{legend.loc}{Location of legend: will be recycled panelwise. If \code{NA}, a legend is ommitted for that panel}
  \item{legend.pars}{Additional arguments, passed as a list, to be passed to \code{legend}. Will not recycle}
  \item{events}{A list with mandatory elements \code{time} and \code{label} and optional 
  elements \code{col},\code{lty} giving the events to be highlighted. See examples.
  
  For further control, list elements \code{pos} and \code{offset} can be passed to place the text as well; even further control is allowed by \code{y.adj} providing the size of a downwards shift in the label.}
  \item{blocks}{A list with mandatory elements \code{start.time} and \code{end.time} and 
  optional element \code{col} giving time-blocks to be highlighted. See examples.}
  \item{nc}{Number of columns to be used if \code{layout} is set to \code{'auto'}.}
  \item{nr}{Number of rows to be used if \code{layout} is set to \code{'auto'}.}
  \item{\dots}{additional graphical arguments}
}
\details{
Mainly used to draw time-series plots with sensible x-axis labels, it
can also plot basic OHLC series using \code{type='candles'} or \code{type='bars'}.

Care has been taken to make plotting arguments passed by \code{...} behave smartly by classifying them as 'global', 'screen-wise', or 'column-wise' arguments and treating them as such. A partial listing includes:
\itemize{
  \item Global parameters: \code{main}
  \item Screen-wise parameters: \code{log}, \code{ylab}
  \item Column-wise parameters: \code{col},\code{type},\code{lwd}, \code{pch}, \code{cex}, \code{lty} 
}
Arguments that are not set to recycle are applied to all the plots via \code{par} internally; \code{par} is reset to the user's previous state upon exiting the function. 

Better financial plots can be found in the \pkg{quantmod} package, though
these are generally incompatible with standard R graphics tools.
}
\value{Invisibly returns the plotted object (or the merged object in the scatterplot case). Also assigns \code{.plot.xts} to \code{.GlobalEnv} which can be used to "replay" the plot.}
