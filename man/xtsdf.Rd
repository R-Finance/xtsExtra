\title{ Create Or Test For An xtsdf Time-Series Object }
\description{
Constructor function for creating an extensible time-series data.frame object.

\code{xtsdf} is used to create an \code{xtsdf} object from raw data inputs and \code{as.xtsdf} is used for coercion to the same.
}
\usage{
xtsdf(..., order.by = index(x), frequency = NULL, unique = TRUE, tzone = Sys.getenv("TZ"), stringsAsFactors = default.stringsAsFactors(), check.names = TRUE)

as.xtsdf(x, ...)

is.xtsdf(x)
}

\arguments{
  \item{\dots}{ Columns of the resulting \code{xtsdf} object. Names will be extracted as with \code{data.frame}}
  \item{order.by}{ a corresponding vector of unique times/dates - must be
of a known time-based class. See details of \code{xts}.}
  \item{frequency}{ numeric indicating frequency of \code{order.by}. See details of \code{xts}. }
  \item{unique}{Logical. Should index be checked for unique time-stamps? }
  \item{tzone}{ time zone of series }
  \item{stringsAsFactors}{Logical. Should strings be converted to factors? Note that \code{xts} does not currently support factors so this doesn't really do much..}
  \item{check.names}{Logical. Should column names be made syntactically correct?}
  \item{x}{An object to be tested or coerced to class \code{xtsdf}.}
}
\details{
An \code{xtsdf} object creates a time ordered \code{data.frame} like object; internally it is implemented as a list of \code{xts} objects, but it should behave like a \code{data.frame} rather transparently. The class is still under heavy development and feedback is welcome. Imporantly, this now allows \code{xts}-like behavior for objects with different column classes.



Subsetting inherits ISO8601 subsetting from \code{xts} as well as standard R subsetting. Double bracket (\code{[[}) subsetting inherits from the underlying list structure. Note that the default for subsetting is \code{drop = FALSE} following \code{xts} rather than \code{data.frame}. This is subject to change.

}
\value{
An S3 object of class \code{xtsdf}.
