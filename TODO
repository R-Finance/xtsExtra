TODO list for GSOC 2012 / xtsExtra

MULTITYPE OBJECTS 
  -- Most everything
  
ANALYTICS
  -- regularize()
  
GRAPHICS
  -- plot.xts
    -- Features: 
         auto-legend: use code from Performance Analytics. Nees to support blocks, events, lines, etc. 
         xlim acting panelwise
         xlim to allow plotting trading hours only
         ylab.loc = "above" -- put ylabels where titles normally go
    -- Bugs: 
        ylim: Need to align ylim for ylab.loc = "none" or else its disengenuous
        
    -- Not Sure: 
        x <- as.xts(sample_matrix); plot(cbind(x, x[,1]), layout = matrix(1:6, ncol = 2)) -- is this a bug? ggplot2 is ok with it
        
    -- Long term: 
        Do layout with layout so we can move back and forth among screens?
        Write demo or vignette
  -- barplot.xts
